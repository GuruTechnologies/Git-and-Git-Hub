#	Git - Branching and Merging


## What is the branch is for?

-	Branch is for parallel development
-	New features
-	Isolated development

##	How branch is implemented

-	A branch is just a pointer to commit
-	EX: Master branch pointing to second commit
-	The way git knows which branch we are on is by using HEAD pointer

## 	HEAD

-	HEAD is a pointer that normally points to a branch
-	Since HEAD Pointer normally points to branch its also called as symbolic pointer
-	HEAD Pointer tell us what we have checked out


## Git log with graph

-	alias graph="git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"
-	graph 
-	shows the details of all the commits and branches
-	shows where HEAD is pointing to which branch

	Example Logs:

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise (auth)
		$ graph
		* fc0bfc2 (HEAD -> auth) f3 changed in auth
		| * b62c952 (sdn)  On branch sdn
		|/
		* 3510d09 (master) f3
		* f6eb91a  Initial commit

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise (auth)
		$ git checkout sdn
		Switched to branch 'sdn'

		iambh@Guru-Raghavendra MINGW64 /c/Bharath_Courses/GitAndGitHub/Practise (sdn)
		$ graph
		* fc0bfc2 (auth) f3 changed in auth
		| * b62c952 (HEAD -> sdn)  On branch sdn
		|/
		* 3510d09 (master) f3
		* f6eb91a  Initial commit
	

##	Git Merges

-	Fast-Forward Merge 
-	3 Way Merge

### Fast-Forward Merge

-	Fast-Forward merge is a straight forward merge
-	Master branch will forward to the latest commit the branch to be merged
	-	Even if there can be multiple commits with in the branch


-	Checking difference b/w two different branches

		git diff master..sdn
	
	-	above command gives the difference b/w the branches

-	git merge sdn

	-	above is a Fast forward merge

	##	Deleting branches

	-	Once work is completed on the branch and its got merged with master branch
		-	We can delete that particular branch

	-	git command to delete the branch

		git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>
		
		git branch -d sdn

	## How to check which branches got merged

	-	git command to check which branches got merged

		git branch --merged

### 3-Way merge

-	Git will use 3 way merge if there is no direct path b/w the branches
-	Git cant just move the HEAD to new branch, since it may loose the previous branch changes
	-	To avoid this git will look at previous master branch and latest two branches
-	We need to merge two commits to a new merge commit
	-	To make merge commit git will look at 
		-	Base Commit that two branches started from
		-	Then the last commit of each branch

-	Command to do 3-way merge

	-	git merge auth

-	If there were no conflicts then git will do 3-way recursive merge
	-	with a message 'Merge made by recursive strategy'
