# Git and Git Hub


## What is Git 

-	Git is a Version Control System for tracking changes in computer files
	-	Distributed version control or decentralized version control system
		-	Many developers can work on single project with out being needs to be in same n/w
	-	Coordinates work b/w multiple developers
		-	Git tracks every single changes(versions) done by different developers on the system or project
	-	Who made what changes and when
	-	Revert back at any time
		-	We can revert the changes to specific version as long it is commited to the repository
	-	Local and remote repos
		-	We can work with local repos with out internet connection
		-	But to push the changes to remote repo then we need internet connection
		
		
	
##	Concepts Of Git

-	Keeps tracks of code history
	-	Keeps of tracks of code history by taking snapshots of files
	-	Snapshots are created with simple commit command
-	Takes snapshots of your files
-	We decide when to take snapshots by making a commit
-	We can visit any snapshot at any time
-	We can stage files before committing to repo
	-	Before taking snapshot or committing to repo we can stage the files in the staging area
	-	staging is done using simple 'add' command

## 3 Areas of Git Repository

-	Git Commit Graph
	-	Every Commit in Git is a Snapshot 
	-	Git tracks every single commit
	-	And can revert back to particular snaphshot at any point in time

-	Git has 3 logical areas 
	-	Working Tree
		-	This is where we will modify our files
		-	Delete, update, add new files etc...
	
	-	Staging Area or Index
		-	Staging Area is place where we put all the files that will be committed in next commit
		-	Place before committing to local repo

	-	History or Local Repo
		-	This area is also known as Git Commit Graph area
		-	All committed files will be in this location


	
##	Basic Commands

-	$ git init 

	-	git init is used to initialize local repo 
	-	git init will initialized in current folder
	-	git init will create a .git folder and .git hidden directory contains all the repository details
	-	Once git is initialized then we can start running git commands
	
-	$ git add <file>
	-	git add command is used to add files to staging area before committing to remote repos
	-	git add command adds files to staging area or Index 
	-	git add command can be executed as many times

-	$ git status 

	-	shows the status of working tree
	-	Shows diff b/w working copy and staging area
	
-	$	git commit
	-	git commit pushes the changes in staging area or index to local repository

-	$ git push
	-	git push command pushes the changes in local repository to remote repository like git hub or bitbucket
	-	we can add remote repo and set username and password or SSH keys
	
	
-	$ git pull 

	- 	git pull command will pull the latest changes from repository

-	$ git clone

	-	git clone is used to clone repository into new folder
	
	
-	$ git log 

	- 	git log command provides the logs of recent commits
	-	git log -p command gives what are all the changes in each commit

-	$ git diff

	-	git diff is used to see the difference b/w working tree and staging area
	-	git diff can be used to see the difference b/w Staged Area and most recent commit (local repo)
	-	Below command gives the difference b/w staging area and most recent commit

		git diff --staged


## Installing Git

-	Linux (Debian)

	-	$ sudo apt-get install git
	
-	Linux (Fedora)

	-	$ sudo yum install git
	
-	Windows 
	-	http://git-scm.com/download/win
	
	
## git config

-	Before running any git commands ... we need to configure git information about user
	
	git config  --global user.name 'Bharath Ashok'
	git config --global user.email 'me@bharath.com'
	
## git hands on

-	git add command will add file to staging area or index area
		
		git add a.txt

-	to check what's there in staging area we need to run git status
		
		git status
		
-	to remove indexed files from staging area 

		git rm --cached a.txt
		
-	git commit will pop the commit file if we didn't pass any arguments

-	git commit -m 'Message' is 	used to pass the message as part of git commit command


##	.gitignore

-	.gitignore file is used to specify the files and folders that we don't want in repository
-	Even if we do git add .(everything) then git will ignore files specified in .gitignore file
	
		
-	$ git status

		On branch master
		Untracked files:
		  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

				.gitignore
				log.txt

		
-	After adding log.txt filename in .gitignore file		
		
-	$ git status

		On branch master
		Untracked files:
		  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

				.gitignore


## git branches

-	Why we needs to create a branches

	-	Team Development
	-	Assigning one branch to particular developers
	-	Creating a branch for particular feature
	-	Isolated Development
		-	Changes made by individual developer will not mess up with other changes

-	Creating a new branch

		git branch login
	
-	Checking all the available branches
	
		git branch

			develop
			login
			master
	
-	Switching to another branch

		git checkout login
	
-	Merging two branches
	-	execute from master branch
	
		git merge login

-	Creating workflow
-	Creating a reference branch


## Git Remote Urls


-	Create Remote repo in Git Hub or Bit Bucket
-	Commands to add remote git repo 
	
	
	git remote add origin https://github.com/iambharath/core-java
	
	git remote
	
	git push -u origin master
	
	

##	Undoing working tree changes

-	If we change some files in the working area and didn't staged yet
-	We undo the changes of working tree by checking it from staged area
		

		git checkout -- s1

		git checkout -- <FILE_NAME>


## Undo Staged files

-	We have modified file in working area
-	Changed file has added to staging area
-	Now we want to undo the changes of staged file by getting latest file from latest commit to local repo
-	Command to undo the staged files from local repo

	git reset HEAD S1
	git reset HEAD <FILE_NAME>

-	Above command will unstage the file from staging area
-	Working area will have same changed file	

## Restore file from earlier commit

-	git log -- S2
-	git  checkout 9dd9 -- S2

-	This is will place the file also in the staged area
